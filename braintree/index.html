            <p>Hi Braintree, my name is Derek.</p>
            <p>I'm 23 years old. I'm a <b>Designer and Artist</b>. I find inspiration in areas where clarity and humanity collide.</p>
            <p>It's taking me a while to figure out exactly what I want to be when I grow up. I've spent time dabbling in industrial design, architecture, music, engineering, illustration, video game design, fashion design, typography and lettering, slight-of-hand, filmmaking, stage lighting, programming, writing; I've spent a lot of time at the library.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I'd like to think that I can learn how to do everything. There's definitely lots of cool stuff out there to learn about, but I'm realizing the wisdom in hunkering down and learning a few things at a time, and branching out from my current strengths. Like the Lithuanians say, "You cannot shit in every bush."</p>
            <p>I know that I'm adaptable. I thrive in an enviroment where variety is the norm. I'm not afraid of trying new things because I know I will eventually figure out how they work.</p>

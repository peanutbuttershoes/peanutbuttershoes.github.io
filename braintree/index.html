            <p>Hi Braintree, My name is Derek.</p>
            <p>I'm <b>adaptable</b>. Where others feel like they're shifting without a clutch, I'm rolling with the punches. I thrive in an enviroment where variety is the norm. I'm not afraid of trying new things because I know I will eventually figure out how they work.</p>
            <p>I'm <b>persistent</b> in solving problems. I keep marching forward until I achieve my goals.</p>
            <p>I'm creative and. I realize that drawing can make you a better writer, that cooking can make you a better developer. That debugging code can make you a better </p>
            <p>I like history, industrial design, architecture, illustration, video game design, politics, fashion design, typography and lettering, slight-of-hand, filmmaking, stage lighting, security vulnerabilities, programming, film editing, writing, and blah blah blah...</p>
            <p>Sometimes I like to think that I can learn how to do <b>everything</b>. There's definitely lots of cool stuff out there to learn about.</p>
            <p>But I'm realizing more and more lately the wisdom in hunkering down and learning a <b>few things</b> at a time, and working within my strengths.</p>

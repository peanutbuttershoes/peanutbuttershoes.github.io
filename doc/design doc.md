##site goals:

As a portfolio of digital design work it is essentially necessary that this site be very, very aware of it's field and should appear as a complete project, not as a work in progress.

Despite this aspiration, there needs to be an awareness of faults and tendencies in my design; and hopefully to a lesser degree, it's contents.
Be critical, not necessarily with the intent to minimize a "flaw" later on, but to ensure it's proper proportion to other more acceptable "flaws".
